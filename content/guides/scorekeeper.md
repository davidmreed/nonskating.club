## Introduction

As with all officiating positions in roller derby, itâ€™s important to be aware that Scorekeeping is a combination of *what the rules explicitly say*, *how the rules are interpreted by the community*, and *common practices that are not rule-driven*.

Scorekeeping, in particular, is driven by the needs of the WFTDA Statsbook. TODO

## The Basic Routine

Scorekeepers are typically seated on each side of the scoreboard operator, but the location of the score table varies from venue to venue.

Watch your Jam Referee and Jammer (in that order) during each jam. Follow the Statsbook Manual's instructions to record points and jam events (Lost Lead, Lead, Call, Injury, No Initial; Star Passes). **This guide deliberately does not cover the paperwork, because the Statsbook Manual is the authority**.

When each event happens, or when points are awarded, verbally communicate it to the Scoreboard Operator. The Scoreboard Operator should echo this back to you to indicate that they received it.

For example, a jam might go like this:

> Jam Timer: *short whistle* to start jam.<br />
> *Play begins*<br />
> Jam Referee Blue: *two short whistle blasts* to indicate lead.<br />
> Scorekeeper Blue: Blue lead<br />
> Scoreboard Operator: Blue lead, got it.<br />
> *Play continues*<br />
> Jam Referee Blue: *holds up three fingers*<br />
> Scorekeeper Blue: *holds up three fingers* Three points Blue.<br />
> Scoreboard Operator: Three points Blue, got it.<br />
> Scorekeeper Blue: *makes eye contact with Jam Referee Blue while signaling*.<br />
> Jam Referee Blue: *nods*<br />
> Referees: *signals star pass*<br />
> Scorekeeper Red: *Signals star pass*. Star pass red. New jammer is Red 052.<br />
> Scoreboard Operator and Scorekeeper Blue: Star pass red, got it.<br />
> Jam Referee Blue: *holds up four fingers*<br />
> Scorekeeper Blue: Four points Blue.<br />
> Scoreboard Operator: Four points Blue, got it.<br />
> Scorekeeper Red: Red initial trip complete.<br />
> Scoreboard Operator: Red initial, got it.<br />
> Jam Referee Blue: *four short whistle blasts*<br />
> Scorekeeper Blue: Blue call.<br />
> Scoreboard Operator: Blue call, got it. Total score is 109 Blue to 87 Red.<br />
> Scorekeeper Blue: 109 blue confirmed.<br />
> Scorekeeper Red: 87 red confirmed.<br />

The conversation doesn't have to go exactly like this. Nobody needs to use these exact phrases. The scorekeepers could confirm the total rather than the scoreboard operator. Someone might miss an event and hear it from a colleague. 

What's important in this example is that the two scorekeepers and the scoreboard operator are _talking constantly_. They make sure that everyone has the information they need to do their jobs. They acknowledge that a game environment is noisy and fast-moving by confirming what they hear. And they make sure to check their most important job - keeping the visible score accurate - constantly, so that problems are caught right away while the rules still permit a correction.

Why call out these specific pieces of information?

- The Scoreboard Operator needs to know all of these events so that they can reflect them on the official scoreboard. Because they're monitoring both scorekeepers, they may not be able to collect all of the data themselves and rely on the scorekeepers to feed them data.
- The scorekeepers _both_ record star passes for _both_ teams. Since each scorekeeper is watching their own Jam Referee, they need to make sure their counterparts receive notice when a star pass occurs for the other team.
- Redundancy - the two scorekeepers plus that data in the scoreboard - increases the likelihood that a correct game record can be achieved during statsbook data entry.

Your Jam Referee will signal points to you starting when the jammer leaves the Engagement Zone (TODO reference). Many Jam Referees will continue to signal until the jammer enters the Engagement Zone for their next scoring trip. You should do the same. Remember that your signal may be seen by others throughout the venue, not just by your Jam Referee confirming that you've caught the points.

You do not need to echo other signals, such as the Lead sign or No Pass-No Penalty. Some scorekeepers do, but it may provoke confusion.

### Start-of-Game Check-ins

Before the game, your assigned Jammer Referee should meet with you to show you their hand signals. Echo the signals back to them as they make them. Make sure to ask the Jammer Referee what signal they use for "No Initial Trip": there is no standard signal for this, and a number of different conventions are in wide use.

### End-of-Period and End-of-Game Responsibilities

At the end of each period, the scorekeeper should perform a series of steps to validate their points and paperwork.

1. The jam referees should visit the score table to confirm the recording of the last jam's score. Points may be corrected only for the final jam.
2. The scorekeeper totals all of the Trip columns to the bottom row, and verifies that the sum of the Trip columns is equal to the sum of the Jam Total column. If the game is over, also verify that this sum plus the carried-over Period 1 score is equal to the displayed final score.
3. The scorekeeper calculates the Period 2 total to provide to the Head NSO for the IGRF.

## Communication

### Jam Referee

There is no standard signal for "a star pass occurred". It is very common for referees and NSOs based in the center of the track to signal this by touching their hands and raising their hands repeatedly, sometimes with a plucking motion. This may indicate a star pass for _either_ team. You may echo this signal but don't need to.

_Always_ make sure that your co-scorekeeper and scoreboard operator are aware of the star pass.

Situations where an illegal or incomplete star pass occurs can be quite confusing. You should always watch and take your cues from your Jam Referee. TODO: elaborate

## Paperwork Beyond the Manual

Many experienced scorekeepers go beyond what's specified in the Statsbook Manual. The conventions you adopt should always be _additive_, not _contrastive_: you can write down more information than the Statsbook Manual requires in the margins or un-marked areas of your paperwork, but do not make non-standard marks in standard spaces. This will produce confusion for your Head NSO when they complete the statsbook.

Writing down the pivot's number in the margin of your score sheet, to the left of the Jam column, is a very common and useful convention. This ensures that when a star pass occurs, you have the pivot number you need at hand; you may not be able to see the pivot when the star pass actually takes place. It also allows your paperwork to support the Penalty Lineup Tracker's during statsbook data entry.

It may be useful to mark the margin of your paperwork with a symbol, such as a horizontal line, on each jam in which a Star Pass occurs. This makes it easier for you to rapidly count Star Passes to confirm that you are in sync with the other scorekeeper or with a Penalty Lineup Tracker.

Some scorekeepers use "Dot System". Dot System is a way to annotate your paperwork with more information about the progress of the jam, which can help you keep track of scoring trips. This guide deliberately does not cover Dot System. You can read about it [here](TODO). We neither encourage nor discourage the Dot System. We encourage reviewing it and experimenting to find what makes you most effective.

### Understanding the Statsbook

### Notating Substitutions

## Common Paperwork Mistakes

### Star Passes and Trips

Notating Star Passes is often confusing for newer scorekeepers. The key principles to remember are:

1. The _meanings_ of all of the boxes on your paperwork stay the same.
1. A completed scoring trip belongs to the jammer who finished the trip.

For example, suppose that White 32 passes the star to the pivot, White 494, during the initial trip. White 494 is unable to clear the pack, and never starts their first scoring trip. You'd record it like this:

{% score() %}
1 32 - - - - X - - - - - - - - 0 0
SP 494 - - - - X - - - - - - - - 0 0
{% end %}

The definition of the "No Initial Trip" box stays the same. _Both_ jammers failed to complete an initial pass, so it's marked for both.

What if White 494 _had_ gotten out of the pack, but the opposing jammer called the jam before they could score any points?

{% score() %}
1 32 - - - - X - - - - - - - - 0 0
SP 494 - - - - - 0 - - - - - - - 0 0
{% end %}

The definitions stay the same: White 32 had no initial trip, but White 494 did complete the initial trip. White 494 started the scoring trip, so the 0 belongs to them and goes on the Star Pass row.

Take a different scenario. Blue 02 gets Lead status. They score 4 points on the first scoring trip. During the second scoring trip, they get stuck and pass the star to Blue 999, who completes the second and third scoring trips. We'd complete the paperwork thus:

{% score() %}
1 02 X X - - - 4 - - - - - - - 4 4
SP 999 - - - - - - 4 3 - - - - - 7 11
{% end %}

Definitions stay the same. Jammer 02 got Lead, and then Lost Lead by removing their helmet cover. Both of those marks belong to the row for Jam 1. The Jam Total and Game Total columns function just like they do elsewhere: total up the points for each row, and maintain the running total.

Jammer 02 completed the first scoring trip _before_ they passed the star, so the first 4 belongs to their row. However, Blue 02 did _not_ complete the second scoring trip; Blue 999 did. The points for scoring trips 2 and 3 _both_ go in the row for Blue 999, the Star Pass row. It's irrelevant if Blue 02 actually earned some points before handing off the star. The record of the scoring trip belongs to the skater who completed the trip.

The Statsbook Manual offers many examples of how to complete Star Pass paperwork correctly. Apply these two principles consistently and you'll be able to handle any in-game situation.

### Missed Star Passes

{% score() %}
1 32 - X X - - 4 - - - - - - - 4 4
2 99 - X X - - 4 4 - - - - - - 8 12
{% end %}

### Closing Zero Trips

### Lost Lead

### Math Errors

## Score Corrections

Mistakes happen all the time. Roller derby is not a precise science!

- During the first period and during the first 28 minutes of play in the second period, you may make a correction to the score _until the end of the following jam_.
- During the final two minutes of play in the second period, you may make a correction to the score _until the following jam starts_. That is, you can only correct a jam's score during that jam and during the following lineup period, barring any stoppage of play.

What if there's a math error that you do not catch in time to fix it?

You shouldn't have to worry about math, in general. If you're verifying totals with the scoreboard operator every single jam, you'll constantly have your math validated by the computer.


It's unusual for scorekeepers to lose track of the jam number, because their paperwork involves making an entry every single jam. If you do, however, check against the scoreboard to get back on track.

WHat if I never see a jammer's number (for example, a jam that ends almost instantly)?

What if my jam referee does not signal points to me, I miss points?

What if I disagree with my jam referee's points count?


## Pragmatics and Training

It's very common for scorekeepers to have limited experience in the position. Crews that are short on non-skating officials will press skaters or jam referees into scorekeeping duty. Many scorekeepers are trained primarily at practices and scrimmages, where the scoreboard may not be used and the full team of scoreboard operator and other scorekeeper are not available.

In many cases, but certainly not all, the scoreboard operator is a more experienced non-skating official. (The scoreboard is not difficult to operate, but has many challenges and edge cases). If that's your situation, take advantage of their expertise. Draw on your other scorekeeper too, or lend them your expertise if they need it. However, always make sure to do your own job first.

When the NSO crew is very limited, it's possible to go with a single scorekeeper and a scoreboard operator. In extreme circumstances, it's possible even to have the scoreboard operator catch points for both teams. While this situation _could_ meet the standards for a sanctioned game (which does not require a specific position count for NSOs), it's very risky and not recommended.
